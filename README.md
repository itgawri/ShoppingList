# ShoppingList
The "Shopping List Application" project aims to facilitate daily shopping and keep track of which products have already been purchased and which are still needed. Below, we present the project's code and its description.

At the beginning of the project, we have a shopping list (variable "shopping_list") containing products that need to be purchased. The project's code allows for modifications to this list, such as adding products (e.g., "batteries"), inserting items at specific positions (e.g., "chocolate" at the beginning), and changing a product on the list (changing "chocolate" to "dark chocolate"). The final operation is removing the last item from the list.

Next, the project creates a list of purchased items (variable "purchased_list") and compares it to the shopping list. Using a for loop, it checks which products from the shopping list have not been purchased and adds them to the list of unavailable items (variable "unavailable_items").

If there are any unavailable items on the shopping list, the project displays a message informing the user about these products. Otherwise, if all products have been purchased, the project congratulates the user.

Finally, the project checks whether the user purchased any items that were not on the shopping list and, if so, adds them to the list of special items (variable "special_items").

If there are special items on the list, the project displays a message informing the user about these products that were purchased but were not on the shopping list.

The "Shopping List Application" project helps with managing shopping and tracking which products have been purchased and which are still needed, enhancing the efficiency and organization of daily shopping.
